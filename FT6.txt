02. Option to make drawing visible on the TF drawn and lower, not higher.
03. Option to sync TF and or chart area on speceic charts.

# What I like about FT6
1. Keyboard shortcut key to lower or higher the Time Frame.
2. Sessions Indicator.
3. Ctrl+Scroll shows more or less candles.
4. Changing the time frames still keeps the same range. i.e. when i change time frame the candles scrolls in left or get added in left of the chart and it does'nt scrolls me to the begining.
5. Invert Chart.
6. End key scrolls to the latest candle and the Home key takes to the last candle.
