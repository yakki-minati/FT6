11. Option to rearrange templets.

14. Option to draw by Dragging and holding, rather than clicking on the first point to start and at the end to stop.
15. How to Download MINE, LINE and Holidays.
16. Shortcut to Scroll the Price Scale.
17. Why theres a shadow under the highlighted/selected icon.
18. Why do i have to manually backup the templets folder, why not a simple backup and restore options in settings. Also for templates and chart appereanc so they can be easire to share in Community as themes.
19. Option to lock drawings so they can't be edited or deleated while they are locked.

31. Shortcut key or option or buttion to directly jump on next days specefic time, for example at 0830 thats when i start trading.
32. Holding on Shortcut key while drawing to activate Snap to closet OHLC.
33. Why do i have to manually enable or disable visibility for drawings on newly added time frames. Slider on TV is better.

35. Why there is no OHLCV data or time or any other data on the Undocked chart.

51. Saving drawing on chart, rather than saving charts Templets. So If A chart has drawing, after closing it should still keep its drawing so that chart can be reopened at a later time.

53. Option for Background colours in Fib.

# What I like about FT6
01. Keyboard shortcut key to lower or higher the Time Frame.

05. Invert Chart.
06. End key scrolls to the latest candle and the Home key takes to the last candle.
07. Drawing and Cursor Magnet and able to customize its sencitivity.
08. List of Objects.
09. Drawing Templets.
10. Sync of Charts Data range.
